## Run the Project


docker compose up --build

Open in browser:

http://localhost


## Verify Load Balancing

Refresh the browser multiple times:

http://localhost

Responses alternate between:
- app1
- app2

You can also test using:

curl http://localhost


## Test Internal Container Communication

docker exec -it nginx sh
curl http://app1:5000
curl http://app2:5000

Docker Compose automatically creates a shared bridge network where containers communicate using service names as DNS hostnames.


NGINX routes incoming traffic to backend Flask containers using upstream load balancing and Docker internal networking.
